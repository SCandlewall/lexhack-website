	<!-- yeah that prevents zooming well -->
	<!-- devices figure out how many of their pixels correspond to a css pixel, and then use that length
the conversion isn't perfect -->
	<script src="js/menu.js"></script>
	<!-- that caused a lot of problems, why? Actually it didn't, it just didn't fix the main problem.
		i won't try to fix the zooming bug. this does successfully inform the site of how big the phone actually is, so it doesn't try
	to render 1000 pixels wide.

	so if phone is actually 320 pixels wide, a div set to 320 px spans the screen horizontally

	but definitely make it work for desktops first

				<p>
					<span>LexHack</span> is a hackathon for high schoolers of all programming abilities.
					It&#8217;s free, all day (12 hours), and equipped with hackable hardware
					(e.g. Arduino, Raspberry Pi), great prizes, tons of swag, delicious
					food (all meals provided!), and mentors to help you build your project.
					It&#8217;s <span>Saturday, November 3rd</span> in commons 1 and 2 of Lexington High School. Sign up to be a hacker <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdzF_6ssNhsuQ_XYYV5jxhvJ1wAPay5oROgkAb6vC3UJ1THjA/viewform">here</a>.

				<p>
					<span>What is a hackathon?</span> A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon">hackathon</a>
					is an engineering and coding
					event where students collaborate to build or program entire projects.
					Come with a team of friends, or create a team at the event and
					make new ones. LexHack&#8217;s mission is to spread the love of programming and innovation to
					everyone by making our event as accessible as possible.
				</p>

				<p>
					<span>What if I have no programming experience?</span> No problem! You can <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/upRAMPwAMAWqLaz32">sign up</a> 
					for a free coding workshop graciously hosted by our sponsor, Penguin Coding School.
					Our mentors can also help you
					get started making a basic web app with our <a href="http://start.lexhack.org/">start guide</a>. 
					Need ideas? Look at this list of <a href="https://www.codementor.io/npostolovski/40-side-project-ideas-for-software-engineers-g8xckyxef">project ideas</a> to help get you started.
